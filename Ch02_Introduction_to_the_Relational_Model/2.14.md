--------------------------------

We assume that there is an **ID** attribute on the **employee** relation.

We also assume that the attributes **person_name** and **company_name** are UNIQUE in the relations
**employee** and **company** respectively. 

a. $$\Pi_{ID, person\_name}(employee \bowtie_{employee.person\_name = works.person\_name} \sigma_{company\_name="BigBank"}(works))$$

b. $$\Pi_{ID, person\_name, city}(employee \bowtie_{employee.person\_name = works.person\_name} \sigma_{company\_name="BigBank"}(works))$$

c. $$\Pi_{ID, person\_name, street, city}(employee \bowtie_{employee.person\_name = works.person\_name} \sigma_{company\_name="BigBank" \wedge salary > 10000 }(works))$$

d. 

Method 1: 

$$S1 \leftarrow (company \bowtie_{company.company\_name = works.company\_name} works)$$

$$\Pi_{ID, person\_name} (S1 \bowtie_{S1.person\_name = employee.person\_name \wedge S1.city = employee.city} employee))$$

Method 2: 

$$\Pi_{ID, person\_name}(employee \bowtie_{employee.person\_name = works.person\_name} works \bowtie_{works.company\_name = company.company\_name \wedge employee.city = company.city} company)$$
